Common Lisp REPL Exploration Guide

A cheat sheet for helping new users to familiarize themselves with the Common Lisp REPL. It's a quick reference for everything you need to feel out your lisp environment. It is not a programming guide. 

This edition (Emacs/Slime) assumes that emacs, slime, quicklisp and a Common Lisp implementation are present and configured correctly. It is not an installation guide.
